Fixes:
-file type checking.
-maaaaaybe think about splitting userService into an authservice and an userservice.
-have the frontend uri be dynamic
-remove avatar from registration.

Things I will need to make in the future, and thus will need to be remembered when future-proofing:
-Updating user data (name, avatar etc.).
-Better looking emails lmao.
-Most recent login.
-API key for the entire api, so that you can only use the api from the site.
-OAuth
-Cancellation tokens
